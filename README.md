The CO PO Attainment Management System is a software application developed using Java and NetBeans, which is designed to manage and track the attainment of program outcomes (POs) for educational institutions or organizations. It provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and evaluating the achievement of desired learning outcomes by students or learners enrolled in a program or course. The system allows administrators or educators to define and input the POs, which represent the knowledge, skills, and abilities that students are expected to acquire upon completion of the program. It provides features for defining assessment criteria, setting targets, and recording assessment results for each PO. It may also integrate with other educational systems, such as student information systems or learning management systems, to streamline data collection and analysis processes.
